# MediStat

MediStat is a one tap solution to connect with a doctor for first aid in case of medical emergency. The app provides instant help without much hassle thus saving lives at anytime anyplace.

## Idea

Road accidents have been a major cause of concern across the Indian subcontinent
Each year, about 3-5% of the country's GDP was invested in road accidents.
With mean time of ambulance arrival being 40-47 mins and a mortality rate of 30% the situation is miserable.
Either the ambulance doesn't reach on time and even if it does it is not equipped with trained personnel. The situation is made worse by the lack of awareness and formal training among citizens about basic medical procedures. In order to address this issue, we came up with Medistat
Ours is a one tap solution to connect with a doctor for first aid in case of medical emergency. Our mobile app Medistat is a cross platform mobile app made using flutter
